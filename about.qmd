##### Hello!

I'm currently a student at University of California, Santa Barbara and I have loved my time here. I've lived by the beach for most of my life and living in Goleta has been the best place to find so many opportunities to follow my professional and personal passions. Here are some photos I've taken over the past two years of my favorite spots and memories. I love photography and always wish I had my nicer camera on me, but my phone usually does the trick!

### Hiking

I really love hiking, and it's usually for the purpose of getting outside and eating lunch in a much cooler spot. Intentionally getting outside is sometimes a much needed reset, and the views are always amazing even if I've seen it a dozen times.

### Chasing the snow

One of the only things I can't get on the coast of southern California is snow. I have found some of my absolute favorite spots around Mammoth and Mono County, where I also love to snowboard as much as I can. It is a super fun way to exercise and I love practicing new skills so it stays interesting.

### Shi

And finally, my two favorite pictures of my brother's dog Shi because she is the cutest dog ever and who doesn't like dog pictures. She's super smart when she wants to be, but that isn't always the choice she makes.
