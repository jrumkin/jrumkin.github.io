##### Hello!

I'm currently a student at Univserity of California, Santa Barbara and I have loved my time here. I've lived by the beach for most of my life and living in Goleta has been the best place to find so many opportunities to follow my professional and personal passions.

### Hiking

I really love hiking, and it's usually for the purpose of getting outside and eating lunch in a much cooler spot.

### Chasing the Snow

One of the only things I can't get on the coast of southern California is snow. I have found some of my absolute favorite spots around Mammoth and Mono County, where I also love to snowboard as much as I can.

### Shi

And finally, my two favorite pictures of my brother's dog. She is the cutest thing in the world and who doesn't like dog pictures.
