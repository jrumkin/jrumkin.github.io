Hello! My name is Jessica Rumkin, but I usually go by Jessi.

This is my personal website I built to better showcase my abilities and experience. Check out the Projects page to see a wide variety of experiences, the GitHub link to see the code for this site, or the About page for some more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm currently studying at Utrecht University in the Netherlands to finish my degree in Environmental Studies (B.S.) and an additional emphasis in Geographic Spatial Science. 

At Utrecht University I'm able to focus on geosciences and integrated science and management courses. 

I recently ended two positions as a research assistant for the VEG lab at UCSB, as well as my role as Growing Grounds Coordinator for the non-profit Your Children's Trees. 

Please see the contact links to reach me!
