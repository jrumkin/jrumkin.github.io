Hello! My name is Jessica Rumkin, but I usually go by Jessi.

This is my personal website I built. Check out the Projects page to see a wide variety of experiences, the GitHub link to see the code for this site, or the About page to see some really pretty hiking photos.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm currently studying at University fo California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) for a BS in Environmental Studies with an additional emphasis on Geographic Spatial Science. I'll be finishing my degree at Utrecht University in the Netherlands focusing on geoscience and agroecology innovation.

At my current position I act as a research assistant for the VEG lab at UCSB. I assist with plant measurements in the greenhouse, taking soil samples, and identifying plant species at feild sites to assess percent coverage.

I recently ended my position as Growing Grounds Coordinator for a UCSB club and non-profit called Your Children's Trees due to moving to the Netherlands. I was sad to leave but value my experiences and the people I worked with. I co-managed a nursery of 350+ trees, mostly Coast Live oak, for local urban reforestation and ecosystem restoration and manage weekly volunteer events.

Please see the contact links to reach me!
