Hello! My name is Jessica Rumkin, but I usually go by Jessi.

This is my personal website I built. Check out the Projects page to see a wide variety of experiences, the GitHub link to see the code for this site, or the About page to see some really pretty hiking photos.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm currently studying at University fo California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) for a BS in Environmental Studies with an additional emphasis on Geographic Spatial Science. I'll be finishing my degree at Utrecht University in the Netherlands next fall focusing on restoration and agroecology innovation.

At my current position as Growing Grounds Coordinator for a UCSB club and non-profit called Your Children's Trees I co-manage a nursery of 350+ trees, mostly Coast Live oak, for local urban reforestation and ecosystem restoration. I also manage weekly events to teach and supervise volunteers to maximize their learning and completion of tasks.

Please see the contact links for all the ways to reach me!
