Hello! My name is Jessica Rumkin, but I often go by Jessi.

This is my personal website that I built; here you will find information about me and my profession and academic experience. Check out the Projects page to see a wide variety of experiences, the GitHub link to see the code for this site, or the About page to see some really pretty hiking photos.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm currently studying at University fo California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) for a BS in Environmental Studies with an additional emphasis on Geographic Spatial Science. I will be finishing my degree at Utrecht University in the Netherlands next fall focusing on restoration and agroecology innovation.

At my current position as Growing Grounds Coordinator for a UCSB club and non-profit called Your Children's Trees I co-manage a nursery of 350+ trees, mostly Coast Live oak, for local urban reforestation and ecosystem restoration. I also manage weekly events to delegate, teach, and supervise up to 15 volunteers to maximize their learning and completion of tasks.

Please see the contact links for all the ways to reach me!
