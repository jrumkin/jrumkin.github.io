I Completed an additional emphasis and outside concentration at the University of California, Santa Barbara for Geographic Spatial Science.

The most valuable courses I took to for the additional emphasis were:

1.  GEOG 176A: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Science

    -   This course taught me a solid foundation for what spatial science is, how spatial statistics are unique and can be applied, and procedures for geographic science.

    -   Â Labs provide hands-on experience with GIS and related software, mostly ArcGIS Pro.

2.  GEOG 176B: Technical Issues and Applications for Geographic Information Systems and Science

    -   This course got into underlying technical issues, including coordinate systems and analytic geometry, database models and structures, algorithms and analytical procedures.

    -   Laboratory analysis of digital geographic information from physical and social sources.

3.  GEOG 176C: GIS Design and Applications

    -   Students collaborate to design, develop, and present a GIS pilot study. Covers all stages of a GIS project: planning, design, analysis, and presentation.

    -   Applying GIS theory and techniques to solve problems in land and resource management, utilities, and municipal government.

## Research Project

My biggest accomplishment was the capstone research project, which culminated in the GEOG 176C Symposium where my group members and I got to present our research poster to students, faculty, staff, and professionals in the field.

A special thanks to Dr. Peter Kedron, the UCSB Geography Department, and my amazing research group that made this project possible.
