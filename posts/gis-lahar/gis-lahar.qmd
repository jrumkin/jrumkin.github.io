Capstone project for the UCSB 176A-C course series on geographic information systems and science (GIS).

This group project culminated in a symposium to present our posters and digital artifacts to other students, professors, geography department admin, and professionals. We developed a research project and used ArcGIS Pro to answer spatial questions.
