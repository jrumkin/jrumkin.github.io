Carla D'Antonio's VEG Lab at UC Santa Barbara houses many projects relating to vegetation and ecology. See the lab website [here](https://veglab.eemb.ucsb.edu/){target="_blank"}.

I assisted Nick Saglimbeni on his research at Dangermond Nature Preserve to optimize restoration techniques for the preserve and for further use in other terrestrial coastal ecosystems of California.

Assisting many different tasks came with learning a lot of skills like:

-   sterile lab techniques for handling field samples

-   taking plant measurements

-   identifying species in the field to asses percent coverage

-   taking soil samples in the field

-   data management and accountability

-   field safety, like using radios and awareness of rattlesnakes
