A project for UCSB ENV S 193DS. I collected data on my study habits with several variables to answer my main question: Am I more productive when I work by myself or with at least one other person?

### Set Up

```{r}
#| label: Set up code

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(gt)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(plotly)
library(DT)

mydata <- read.csv("C:/Users/jlrum/MyGit/jrumkin.github.io/posts/personal-data-project/mydata.csv")

```

```{r}
#| label: Summarize data

#summarizing personal data
mydata_summary <-  mydata |> #make an object called mydata_summary using mydata file
  group_by(accompanied) |> #group the sumary by company type
  summarise(mean_score = round(mean(final_productivity_score),digits = 1), #find mean
            sd = round(sd(final_productivity_score), digits = 1), #find standard deviation
            se = round((sd(final_productivity_score)/sqrt(length(final_productivity_score))),digits = 1), #find standard error
            ci_lower = round(mean_score - 1.96 * (sd(final_productivity_score)/ sqrt(length(final_productivity_score))),digits = 1), #find lower confidence interval at 95%
            ci_upper = round(mean_score + 1.96 * (sd(final_productivity_score) / sqrt(length(final_productivity_score))),digits = 1) #find upper confidence interval at 95%
  ) |> 
  mutate(marker = paste0("Type: ", accompanied, "<br>",
                         "Mean: ", mean_score, "<br>",
                         "95% Confidence interval for mean: ", ci_upper, " - ", ci_lower))

```

### Interactive data table

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Brief data dictionary for mydata

Response Variable: Final Productivity Score Pre-selected predictor variable: accompanied (Accompanied or Alone)

Other variables collected: Company type (Alone, Friend, or Acquaintance), Sleep (decimal hour), deadline type (self imposed or external), and weather (Warm, Cold, Wind, or Rain)

Focus Score was self determined using this guideline: (1 is the lowest, 5 is the highest, discrete numeric data)

1: Constantly distracted + brain fog, low critical thinking applied

2: Frequently distracted, trouble staying on task, bored, needed to re-do or re-read instructions many times

3: Occasionally distracted, able to return to the task at hand without severe backtracking

4: Mostly focused, some distractions but they are usually intentional breaks

5: Highly focused, very few to no distractions, efficient workflow

                         "Score: ", focus_score, " × ", "Duration (hr): ", duration_decimal_hour, "<br>",

##### Artist Statement

This data visualization shows my personal data on study habits and productivity throughout the Spring 2025 quarter. The green doodles are data points for when I studied with other people and the purple doodles are data points when I studied on my own, and each dot around or in each doodle represents my focus score for that study session. I took a lot of inspiration from Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi’s Dear Data project for representing data points as small illustrations. I drew the visualization on my iPad using an app called ProCreate. I started by putting a few of my ideas onto one page to see what I liked and honed the idea from there. I drew the mountain range first to represent the slope of my productivity scores over time. I then drew the data points based off the main jitter and mean plot created in Problem 1b and then drew the illustrations last while matching them to actual observations.
