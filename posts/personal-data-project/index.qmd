A project for UCSB ENV S 193DS. I collected data on my study habits with several variables to answer my main question: Am I more productive when I work by myself or with at least one other person?

### Set Up

```{r}
#| label: Set up code

library(tidyverse) #package for making R easier to use, includes many packages
library(here) #package for file management
library(gt) #package for making tables
library(janitor) #package to clean data
library(plotly) #package for making interactive figures
library(DT) #package for making interactive tables

mydata <- read.csv("C:/Users/jlrum/MyGit/jrumkin.github.io/posts/personal-data-project/mydata.csv") #read in mydata file

```

```{r}
#| label: Summarize data

#summarizing personal data
mydata_summary <-  mydata |> #make an object called mydata_summary using mydata file
  group_by(accompanied) |> #group the sumary by company type
  summarise(mean_score = round(mean(final_productivity_score),digits = 1), #find mean
            sd = round(sd(final_productivity_score), digits = 1), #find standard deviation
            se = round((sd(final_productivity_score)/sqrt(length(final_productivity_score))),digits = 1), #find standard error
            ci_lower = round(mean_score - 1.96 * (sd(final_productivity_score)/ sqrt(length(final_productivity_score))),digits = 1), #find lower confidence interval at 95%
            ci_upper = round(mean_score + 1.96 * (sd(final_productivity_score) / sqrt(length(final_productivity_score))),digits = 1) #find upper confidence interval at 95%
  ) |> 
  mutate(marker = paste0("Type: ", accompanied, "<br>", #adding a column called marker which will be called on later by the interactive figure to display the mean and confidence interval
                         "Mean: ", mean_score, "<br>",
                         "95% Confidence interval for mean: ", ci_upper, " - ", ci_lower)) 

```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Note on the Marker Column

This column is created to be the hover-text/tooltip in the interactive figure. This marker column uses defined "text", defined line breaks "<br>", and response variables that call to an existing field.

Ex: "Type: " will print exaclty as that and be the first thing in the marker. Next is accompanied, which calls on that field and will print "Accompanied" or "Alone" depending on where the curser is hovering.

The mutate function to create a marker column is used again in the [Data Visualization Code]

### Interactive data table

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Brief data dictionary for mydata

Response Variable: Final Productivity Score Pre-selected predictor variable: accompanied (Accompanied or Alone)

Other variables collected: Company type (Alone, Friend, or Acquaintance), Sleep (decimal hour), deadline type (self imposed or external), and weather (Warm, Cold, Wind, or Rain)

Focus Score was self determined using this guideline: (1 is the lowest, 5 is the highest, discrete numeric data)

1: Constantly distracted + brain fog, low critical thinking applied

2: Frequently distracted, trouble staying on task, bored, needed to re-do or re-read instructions many times

3: Occasionally distracted, able to return to the task at hand without severe backtracking

4: Mostly focused, some distractions but they are usually intentional breaks

5: Highly focused, very few to no distractions, efficient workflow

### Affective Data Visualization

##### Artist Statement

This affective data visualization captures my study habits and productivity over the Spring 2025 quarter. Each data point is a small doodle: green for studying with others, purple for studying alone. For each observation the height represents my productivity and the count of dots inside or around them indicate my focus score. The larger single dot represents the mean for each category.

I was inspired by Dear Data by Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi. I drew the piece in Procreate on my iPad, beginning with layout sketches then adapting data from a jitter and mean plot I created in R. As I explored the data, I noticed that my study time per day increased over the quarter. That realization shaped the final design: the included mountain range represents the slope of my productivity over time, shifting the focus away from comparison and instead to a visual celebration of the effort I put in throughout the term.
