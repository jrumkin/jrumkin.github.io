My biggest takeaway from this fellowship was learning how to take create and take advantage of opportunities I wouldn't have known how to before.

Being a part of the Educational Opportunity Program at UCSB as a first generation college student has come with its challenges, but the community and support from the other fellows helped me face and grow from them.

The fellowship created structured opportunities to work on networking skills, resume writing, meet with faculty, and set up mentor meetings with Bren students, faculty, and field professionals. I learned so much and will always cherish the time I spent, skilled learned, and friends made from this program.

A special thanks to the Program Director, Heather Stanford, for all her hard work in managing the program and always being in my corner.
