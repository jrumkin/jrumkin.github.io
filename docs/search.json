I’ll be finishing my degree at Utrecht University in the Netherlands next fall focusing on restoration and agroecology innovation.\nAt my current position as Growing Grounds Coordinator for a UCSB club and non-profit called Your Children’s Trees I co-manage a nursery of 350+ trees, mostly Coast Live oak, for local urban reforestation and ecosystem restoration. I also manage weekly events to teach and supervise volunteers to maximize their learning and completion of tasks.\nPlease see the contact links for all the ways to reach me!"
