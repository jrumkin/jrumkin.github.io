Each data point is a small doodle: green for studying with others, purple for studying alone. For each observation the height represents my productivity and the count of dots inside or around them indicate my focus score. The larger single dot represents the mean for each category.\nI was inspired by Dear Data by Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi. I drew the piece in Procreate on my iPad, beginning with layout sketches then adapting data from a jitter and mean plot I created in R. As I explored the data, I noticed that my study time per day increased over the quarter. That realization shaped the final design: the included mountain range represents the slope of my productivity over time, shifting the focus away from comparison and instead to a visual celebration of the effort I put in throughout the term."

    "section": "Brief Description",
    "text": "Brief Description\nLahar Background Lahars are an important and destructive subset of mudflows that can occur with composite volcano activity. Ash, water, and debris travel at rates of up to 30 m/s, reaching as far as 100km from the source (Thouret et al., 2020). These events are extremely dangerous and put surrounding populations at high risk of property damage, injury, and even death.\nThree arrays of AFMs currently exist on Mt. Ruapehu, ranging across the Eastern side of the volcano (fig. 2). Limited information is available on the suitability criteria for existing installation, but existing literature suggests that factors influencing site locations are slope angel, distance from lahar danger zones, surrounding land use, and accessibility (Johnson et al., 2023; Sanderson et al., 2021).\n\n\n\nFig. 3 - Current AFM sites and predicted lahar risk zones"
