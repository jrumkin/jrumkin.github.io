    "section": "Brief Description",
    "text": "Brief Description\nLahar Background Lahars are an important and destructive subset of mudflows that can occur with composite volcano activity. Ash, water, and debris travel at rates of up to 30 m/s, reaching as far as 100km from the source (Thouret et al., 2020). These events are extremely dangerous and put surrounding populations at high risk of property damage, injury, and even death.\nThree arrays of AFMs currently exist on Mt. Ruapehu, ranging across the Eastern side of the volcano (fig. 2). Limited information is available on the suitability criteria for existing installation, but existing literature suggests that factors influencing site locations are slope angel, distance from lahar danger zones, surrounding land use, and accessibility (Johnson et al., 2023; Sanderson et al., 2021).\n\n\n\nFig. 3 - Current AFM sites and predicted lahar risk zones"

I will be graduating this year with a BS in Environmental Studies with an additional emphasis in geographic spatial science.\nA few notable courses I’ve taken are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Studies\nGeographic Spatial Science\n\n\n\nLandscape Ecology and Nature Conservation\nBiodiversity and Conservation\nGlobal Water Supply and Demand\nTraditional Ecological Knowledge\n\n\nTechnical Issues and Applications for Geographic Information Systems and Science\nGIS Design and Applications\n\nResearch project and poster creation\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Education page for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStork Tower at UCSB\n\n\n\n\nRecent Positions\nI recently left two positions I held in Santa Barbara due to moving to the Netherlands. Being in Santa Barbara reminded me how much I love being and working outside.\nI was a research assistant for the VEG lab at UCSB, where I would collect soil samples and plant coverage data. Hiking out to the research sites, my team would identify all the species we could see and determine the number of individuals and percent coverage in each sector. This position solidified how much I love field work and jobs like these keep me passionate for the field. In addition to the field work I would also collect plant measurement data in the lab greenhouse to track plant growth by treatment group over time.\nI was also the Growing Grounds Coordinator for a non-profit called Your Children’s Trees. In this position I oversaw the care of 300+ trees, mostly Coast live oak. While providing and adjusting the care of the trees, I also coordinated weekly events where I delegated and taught volunteer groups of 1-15 people in order to maximize their learning and completing tasks. This position helped me bridge the gap between restoration science and connection to the community. I learned a lot from my supervisor, Ken Knight, and will always value my time I spent at the Harder Growing Grounds."

Each data point is a small doodle: green for studying with others, purple for studying alone. For each observation the height represents my productivity and the count of dots inside or around them indicate my focus score. The larger single dot represents the mean for each category.\nI was inspired by Dear Data by Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi. I drew the piece in Procreate on my iPad, beginning with layout sketches then adapting data from a jitter and mean plot I created in R. As I explored the data, I noticed that my study time per day increased over the quarter. That realization shaped the final design: the included mountain range represents the slope of my productivity over time, shifting the focus away from comparison and instead to a visual celebration of the effort I put in throughout the term."
