I’ve lived by the beach for most of my life and living in Goleta has been the best place to find so many opportunities to follow my professional and personal passions. Here are some photos I’ve taken over the past two years of my favorite spots and memories. I love photography and always wish I had my nicer camera on me, but my phone usually does the trick!\n\n\n\nStork Tower at UCSB\n\n\n\n\n\nIsla Vista Sunset\n\n\n\n\nHiking\nI really love hiking, and it’s usually for the purpose of getting outside and eating lunch in a much cooler spot. Intentionally getting outside is sometimes a much needed reset, and the views are always amazing even if I’ve seen it a dozen times.\n\n\n\nSunrise hike in Southern California\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern California hike with some friends\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise hike with my NPS interns\n\n\n\n\nChasing the snow\nOne of the only things I can’t get on the coast of southern California is snow. I have found some of my absolute favorite spots around Mammoth and Mono County, where I also love to snowboard as much as I can. It is a super fun way to exercise and I love practicing new skills so it stays interesting.\n\n\n\nMcLeod Lake in the spring\n\n\n\n\n\nConvict lake in early spring\n\n\n\n\n\nFriend trip to enjoy fresh snow\n\n\n\n\n\nView on a snowboarding trip\n\n\n\n\nShi\nAnd finally, my two favorite pictures of my brother’s dog Shi because she is the cutest dog ever and who doesn’t like dog pictures. She’s super smart when she wants to be, but that isn’t always the choice she makes.\n\n\n\nShi playing in the snow\n\n\n\n\n\nShi very oddly playing in the snow"

The green doodles are data points for when I studied with other people and the purple doodles are data points when I studied on my own, and each dot around or in each doodle represents my focus score for that study session. I took a lot of inspiration from Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi’s Dear Data project for representing data points as small illustrations. I drew the visualization on my iPad using an app called ProCreate. I started by putting a few of my ideas onto one page to see what I liked and honed the idea from there. I drew the mountain range first to represent the slope of my productivity scores over time. I then drew the data points based off the main jitter and mean plot created in Problem 1b and then drew the illustrations last while matching them to actual observations."

    "section": "Brief Description",
    "text": "Brief Description\nLahar Background Lahars are an important and destructive subset of mudflows that can occur with composite volcano activity. Ash, water, and debris travel at rates of up to 30 m/s, reaching as far as 100km from the source (Thouret et al., 2020). These events are extremely dangerous and put surrounding populations at high risk of property damage, injury, and even death.\nThree arrays of AFMs currently exist on Mt. Ruapehu, ranging across the Eastern side of the volcano (fig. 2). Limited information is available on the suitability criteria for existing installation, but existing literature suggests that factors influencing site locations are slope angel, distance from lahar danger zones, surrounding land use, and accessibility (Johnson et al., 2023; Sanderson et al., 2021)."
